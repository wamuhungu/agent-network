# Agent Communications

This directory stores communication logs between agents in the system.

The communication logs serve several purposes:

1. Provide transparency into agent decision-making
2. Enable debugging of multi-agent interactions
3. Allow for analysis of agent communication patterns
4. Serve as reference for future agent interactions

## Log Format

Each communication file should follow a consistent format:
- Date and time of interaction
- Participating agents
- Context of communication
- Content of messages
- Decisions or actions taken
