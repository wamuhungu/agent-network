# Tests

This directory contains test suites for the agent network system.

## Test Categories

The tests should be organized into:

- Unit tests: Testing individual components
- Integration tests: Testing interactions between components
- System tests: Testing the entire system
- Performance tests: Testing system efficiency and resource usage
- Simulation tests: Testing agent behaviors in simulated environments

## Running Tests

Instructions for running tests will be provided as the testing framework is established.

## Writing Tests

When creating new tests:
1. Clearly document the purpose of each test
2. Ensure tests are isolated and independent
3. Include both positive and negative test cases
4. Mock external dependencies when appropriate
5. Consider edge cases and boundary conditions
