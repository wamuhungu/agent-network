Create a well-structured Git commit with appropriate messages and metadata.

Usage: /git_commit_code [task_id] [type] [summary]

This command creates a standardized Git commit following the project's conventions.

Follow these steps:
1. Check file status with `git status` to see what's changed
2. Stage relevant changes using one of:
   - `git add -A` for all changes
   - `git add [specific files]` for targeted changes
   - `git add -p` for interactive staging of specific chunks
3. View the staged changes with `git diff --staged` to confirm
4. Commit with a structured message:
   ```
   git commit -m "$(cat <<EOF
   [type]: [summary]

   [description of changes]

   Task: [task_id]

   )"
   ```

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes

- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test`: Adding tests, refactoring tests; no production code change
- `chore`: Updating build tasks, package configs, etc; no production code change
